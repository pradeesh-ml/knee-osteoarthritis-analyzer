Diagnosing knee osteoarthritis (OA) typically begins with a detailed discussion about your symptoms, followed by a physical examination. Your doctor will ask questions about the nature of your pain—where it’s located, how long it lasts, what triggers or relieves it, and how it affects your daily activities. Additional questions may cover your medical history, previous knee injuries, occupation, physical activity level, and any family history of arthritis. During the physical exam, the doctor will check for visible swelling, warmth, or redness around the knee, as these can be signs of inflammation. They will gently press on different areas to identify tender spots and assess for joint pain. You may be asked to bend and straighten your knee to evaluate range of motion. Observing how you walk or perform simple leg movements helps assess joint stability and muscle strength. Doctors may also listen or feel for grinding, popping, or clicking sounds during knee movement, which can indicate cartilage wear or other joint issues.

To confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of OA, an X-ray is commonly used. It is a quick, non-invasive imaging test that can reveal key signs of osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing, which suggests cartilage loss; bone spurs (osteophytes), which are extra bits of bone that form around the joint; and changes in bone shape or density, typically where bones rub together due to cartilage breakdown. The X-ray findings also allow doctors to assign a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade, which helps classify how advanced the arthritis is. Although cartilage itself doesn’t show on X-rays, the space between bones gives a good indication of cartilage health. In some cases, especially when symptoms don’t match X-ray findings or another issue is suspected, additional imaging like MRI may be ordered. An MRI can provide detailed images of soft tissues, including cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and the meniscus. Ultrasound may also be used to detect joint fluid, inflammation, or guide joint injections.

Blood tests are generally not required to diagnose osteoarthritis because it is not an inflammatory or autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis. However, if a doctor suspects another cause of knee pain—such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or an infection—they may order blood work to rule those out. In rare cases, joint fluid may be drawn and analyzed to check for crystals (as in gout or pseudogout) or signs of infection.

Doctors also consider risk factors that increase the likelihood of osteoarthritis when diagnosing the condition. These include being over the age of 45, having a history of joint injuries or surgeries, being overweight (which increases joint stress), repetitive strain from sports or work, and a family history of arthritis. It’s also important to differentiate OA from other possible causes of knee pain. These include rheumatoid arthritis (which typically causes more swelling and affects both knees), meniscus or ligament injuries (often due to sports or trauma), bursitis or tendinitis (caused by overuse), and systemic conditions like lupus or gout.

Early diagnosis is important because it allows for better management of symptoms and may help slow disease progression. With early intervention—such as exercise, weight management, and physical therapy—many people can improve their quality of life and avoid or delay more invasive treatments like surgery.

In summary, the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis is based on a combination of your symptoms, physical exam findings, and imaging—usually starting with an X-ray. In most cases, this is enough for your doctor to confirm OA and begin planning an appropriate treatment strategy. Additional tests like MRI or blood work may be used if the diagnosis is unclear or if other conditions are suspected.
